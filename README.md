Co(mposable) RL A(gents): An exploration into type-parametric, composable agents.

Corla agents may be type-parametric in memory representation, policy representation, probability distribution 
(including effectful execution).  We aim to provide relevant abstractions for training in simulated and non-simulated 
environments.

Corla is a work in progress; apologies for the mess.
